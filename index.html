            <p>
<p> Matley Legal is predominantly an  Executive&nbsp;Search&nbsp;(Head-hunting) organisation with a focus on  Partner-and Senior Associate level recruitment for leading UK Regional,  National&nbsp;and International law firms. 
<p>A law graduate subsequently spending many years'  working in the legal profession.&nbsp; Also a qualified Member of the  International Compliance Association. </p>
<p>I have been recruiting into the legal profession  since 2005,&nbsp;have&nbsp;strong working relationships with a number of high  profile lawyers and am well connected to senior decision makers including  Managing Partners, Heads of Department, and HR Directors.&nbsp; Highly  experienced in Search &amp; Selection and Contingency recruitment I pride  myself on my industry knowledge and Search success.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  I have never liked the sales approach to recruitment and aim to guide my  candidates through this often difficult process helping them make the right  long term career choice.&nbsp; Determined to set up a consultancy which does  more than simply act as a middleman passing on CVs from candidate to client, I  provide a more personal, tailor-made, bespoke and thorough recruitment service  and offer my considerable skills and market insight to Partners and Senior  Associates across all disciplines. &nbsp;Clients and candidates alike praise me  for my empathetic approach.&nbsp; Confidentiality and discretion is extremely  important to me.&nbsp; I am well known for my integrity as a head-hunter and as  such candidates know when they are contacted by me there is a genuine  opportunity for them to consider. </p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1358172940021_97"><span id="yui_3_7_2_1_1358172940021_93">The easiest way to contact me is to call  either the office or my mobile number or send an email, details of which are on  the website.&nbsp; Please note this applies in or out of office hours, as I  know it is sometimes difficult for lawyers to make time during the day.&nbsp;  Alternatively please fill in the contact form below and I will get back to you  as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p>Any contact will be treated in the utmost  confidence.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
